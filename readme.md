poc-contract is a folder with contracts, contains erc-20 and test contract for deposit that is throwing event.

Folder orchestrator is simplified copied from gravity-bridge (https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge), i tried to not use anything that is not needed for first version.

Orchestrator folder structure (kept same names as gravity, we will rename when we only left whatâ€™s needed and maybe change structure a bit)

cosmos_gravity - utils for interaction with cosmos chain

gbt - cli program to start various parts of orchestrator (i only left starting of event listening loop)

gravity_proto - this is auto generated from cosmos proto files, i just copied this from gravity repo, do not review this at the moment, our will hopefully be much smaller, just type definitions, for example i needed this for grpc client types

gravity_utils - various utils needed, only copied some (util methods for connection to ethereum and cosmos, types, error types etc)

orchestrator - main thing for us atm, there is loop listening to ethereum events, it is started as cli command

Biggest difference to gravity bridge is that gravity is doing more things not needed by us (at least atm) like relaying stuff to ethereum, transaction batching to ethereum, listening to all those events (we only listen to SendToCosmosEvent so everything else is removed) etc.

To make this work locally apart from starport rust is needed to be installed and then call

1. check poc_contracts to run hardhat

2. run `starport chain serve --verbose` in baseledger folder (if starting from scratch run `starport chain serve --verbose --reset-once` and copy alice and bob mnemonics for further usage)

3. `cargo build --all` in root of orchestrator folder

4. navigate to gbt folder and execute

```shell
cargo run -- init 

cargo run -- keys set-orchestrator-key --phrase="<STARPORT_BOB_PHRASE>"

cargo run -- keys set-ethereum-key --key ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 (using private key for hardhat account 1, this is public information and not sensitive)

cargo run -- keys register-orchestrator-address --fees="0token" --validator-phrase="<STARPORT_ALICE_PHRASE>"

export COINMARKETCAP_API_TOKEN=<token>

cargo run -- orchestrator --fees "0token" --ethereum-rpc="http://localhost:8545" --gravity-contract-address="<BASELEDGER_TEST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>"
```

## Changing and building proto files

- change the proto files in baseledger bridge
- navigate to <root>/baseledger-bridge
- starport chain build --proto-all-modules
- navigate to <root>/orchestrator/proto_build
- cargo run

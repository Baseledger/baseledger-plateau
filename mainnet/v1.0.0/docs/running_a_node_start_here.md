This file is the stating point for everyone wanting to run a Baseledger (validator) node.

1) Applications for becoming a validator node operator have to be cleared by the Baseledger Council first (baseledger.foundation).
Please apply first, using the following form: https://forms.gle/Vcp1t4XFUxmct9yc9
Without an approved application you wont be able to join the network.

2) A Baseledger Node is being run on a dedicated or managed server running linux you have root access to (to run shells, create directories and so on). We recommend Ubuntu 20.0.4 LTS for setting up a node and following the documentation.
Minimum hardware requirements: 4GB RAM, 250GB SSD, x64 2.0 GHz 2v CPU, Static IP address
These kind of servers are offered by most web hosting providers.

3) Once you application is approved, you can start setting up the node. The technical setup on how to do it is layed out in the file add_node_to_baseledger_mainnet.md in this folder. This documentation requires you to have setup the server as described before and have access via a terminal (SSH / PuTTy) to execute commands.

4) During node setup you will be required to receive an initial stake token and initial work token to join the mainnet. Please request the tokens after you've generated you relevant baseledger addreses in step 10 and 11 of `./add_node_to_baseledger_mainnet.md`. You can request tokens by opening a ticket on our support portal stating your newly created Baseledger validator and orchestrator address to send tokens to. Be sure to select "Baseledger" as "Product Name" when opening the ticket and use the same email address for creating the ticket that you used to apply for running a node.
